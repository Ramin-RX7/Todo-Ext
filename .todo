[MAIN]
    ☐ @low @hard formatter
        if number of modules > 5:  set extralines->3  else:2
    ✘ Nested modules?
        (if not, then remove the `\s*` in grammar and
           add the one with whitespace to invalid ones)
        => For now modules can only be at the start of line
    ☐ @med `README.md`
    ☐ @med Documentation for all of the codes
    ✔ @med Tag completion does not start after `@`
    ✔ @med Tag completion adds one more `@`


[CONFIGS]
    ☐ Add the given `todoFiles` to the beginning of the list
        (So firstly user-defined files will be checked)


[TAGS]
    ☐ @easy New tags: [`bug`,`fr`]
    ☐ @high @bug they work in strings
    ☐ @easy Difficulty tags? (easy/norm/hard)
    ? @med @bug should they work alone?
    ?  There should not be tags for `cancelled`,`completed`,etc. =>
         -✔ Instead we can use task symbols
         - but tags can be useful when detecting tasks after that
             task symbols have changed
    ?  tooltip showing the number of tasks with the same tag
    ✔ @med @feature key-bindings


[TASKS-STATUS]
    ?✘ When a text is selected (at the begining of a line) and then, `make task`
        command is called, it should remove the selected part
    ☐ @med @bug when `convert task` is called in a line that is not empty,
         it moves the curser to the end of line after calling the command
    ✔ change opacity of `cancelled` and `done/completed` tasks
    Symbols:
        "cancelled":      🗙  |
        "postponed":      ➜ ➤  |  ➡️
        "assigned" :        |  🚩
        "approveNeeded":    |  📊 ❓ ❔


[TREE-VIEW]
    Tags:
        ☐ @fr shows other tags of the task in tooltip
    Modules:
        ☐ @hard have separate child for `sections`
        ☐ @hard Show tags of task in the tooltip
    Categories:
        ☐ @low @hard   Tooltip should be number of children
    ☐ @med Add task Button
    ☐ @high @bug None of the menu actions work
        (This gets worse because we can not get the task that button is called from)
    ✔ Go to line when clicking on a task
