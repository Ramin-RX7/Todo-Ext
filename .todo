[MAIN]
    ☐ @low @hard formatter
    ?✔ Nested modules?
        (if not, then remove the `\s*` in grammar and
           add the one with whitespace to invalid ones)
        => For now modules can only be at the start of line


[TAGS]
    ☐ New tags: [`bug`]
    ☐ @high @bug they work in strings
    ☐ @med @feature key-bindings
    ? @med @bug should they work alone?
    ?  Difficulty tags? (easy/normal/hard)
    ?  There should not be tags for `cancelled`,`completed`,etc. =>
         - Instead we can use task symbols
         - but tags can be useful when detecting tasks after that
             task symbols have changed


[TASKS-STATUS]
    ☐ change opacity of `cancelled` and `done/completed` tasks
    ?  When a text is selected (at the begining of a line) and then, `make task`
        command is called, it should remove the selected part
    ☐ @bug when `make task` is called in a line that is not empty,
         it moves the curser to the end of line after calling the command
    Symbols:
        "cancelled":      🗙
        "postponed":      ➜ ➤  |  ➡️
        "assigned" :        |  🚩
        "approveNeeded":  📊 ❓ ❔


[COMPLETIONS]
    ✔ tags list after writing `@`
